    <h1>Elephants <strong>Rule</strong></h1>
    <p>Elephants are smart, sassy, and have a good taste in food</p>
    <p><i>Elephants are group-oriented animals that support their family members when in trouble</i></p>
    <p>What is there not to love about elephants?</p>
    <p>They're loud and proud, and have you seen them when they hold trunks?</p>
